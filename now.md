# What is Max Up To Now?

Right now, I'm working on this very website. So far what's interested me the most about the whole process is messing with the *style* of the website. One of my requirements for this site is that it has to show off my style. As you can see, I consider myself a pretty simplistic and plain guy. But as I like to say: Simple is smooth, and smooth is *fast*. I love it when the site navigates like a native program. Plus, i've spent way too much time browsing [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I've started practicing piano every few days. I used to practice every day but it was too much to keep up with. I find that holding myself up to an unnecessarily high standard is a sure-fire way to destroy my motivation. I'm following along with [alfred's adult all-in-one course](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-All-One-Course-Lesson-Theory-Technic/dp/0882848186/ref=asc_df_0882848186/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312166025508&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1530509695768693991&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031939&hvtargid=pla-332970365722&psc=1). RIght now I'm almost finished with [At Last by Etta James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plLs66yTtn8&list=PLT4QnIqosnSbYTb3A92hKeruKaF4K7wBd&index=64)

I'm listening to [Treasure Island](https://www.audible.com/pd/Treasure-Island-Audiobook/B072MLGY5S). It's not the exact book, but instead it's a dramatized version. It's like an audio play. I'm REALLY enjoying it on my walks around the city. If anyone knows of other audio plays like it please [contact me](/#contact-me).

I'm currently living in San Francisco. The weather is a delicious 72 degrees and I'm so happy that I don't have to drag my sweater around everywhere.
