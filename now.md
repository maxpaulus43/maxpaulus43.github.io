# What is Max Up To Now?

Right now, I'm working on this very website! I'm having a ton of fun learning about [gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), [vue](https://vuejs.org/), [netflify](https://www.netlify.com/), [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/), and front end frameworks!

It feels nice to be able to work on something for my own personal joy. With no deadlines to miss, no budgets to break, and some delicious macaroni and cheese by my side, I've been basking in the land of modern frontend. An additional (and planned) nice benefit is that I can totally show off this website to anyone I want!

I've also been working on [ZeitGeist](https://github.com/ZeitgeistOrg), which is a small google chrome extension to figure out what other people are thinking. This has also been quite fulfilling to work on as well. I'm really really enjoying using vue as a frontend framework. I'm taking this project as an opportunity to learn about the [AWS Developer tools](https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/). A little automation is enough to make me giddy.

I'm reading [Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/) by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. I like how instead of talking around self-help, the authors give concrete exercises to complete and prototype (prototyping is very important). I'm listening to [Grit](https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/) by Angela Duckworth. These two books enhance eachother, with Grit speaking more about theory and Designing Your Life more about practice.

Life is really good right now. I'm happy with where it's going. If you want to know more, give me a call: 949-630-8546
