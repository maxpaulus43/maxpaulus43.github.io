# What's Max Up to Now?

Right now, I'm preparing for a wild ride.

**Baby:** I'm officially gonna have a real life daughter in about 2 weeks. I'm not gonna say the name because you're just gonna think it's bad. It's gonna be the most difficult, rewarding experience of my entire life. Thank the gods I have a partner to do it with me.

**Sudoku:** I'm obsessed with sudoku at the moment. Been watching tons of [cracking the cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-UOdK8-mIjxBQm_ot1T-Q) videos and I even bought their [miracle sudoku app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/miracle-sudoku/id1527363795). Who would have though there was so much logic to be learned from a few simple variations to the age old puzzle game?

**Reading:** I've been reading 

1. *Fevre* by George R.R. Martin
2. *How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking* by Jordan Ellenberg
