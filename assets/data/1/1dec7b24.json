I'm having a ton of fun learning about <a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gridsome</a>, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">netflify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">static site generators</a>, and front end frameworks!</p>\n<p>It feels nice to be able to work on something for my own personal joy.
