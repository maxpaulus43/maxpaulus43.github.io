Aerserv was my first job outside of college. Aerserv was a small(ish) advertising platform, until it was acquired by InMobi in 2018. It was here where I learned how much I didn't know about anything.

The work I did here was mostly backend java development and mysql. I took part in a few really fun projects requiring intricate sql queries and lots of java streams. When we were acquired, I helped with a large migration of our system to InMobi's.

Here are a few projects I worked on...

## SdkV3 / Open Auction

Our core backend service was essentially an auction-runner. It ran auctions among advertisers and spit back the advertisement of the highest bidder. SdkV3 of our client-side code fully improved the auction logic from previous versions. It allowed for multiple simultaneous auctions to run at the same time, giving our clients a much better chance of making more money. We had to solve many problems with concurrency and parallel computing. Totally worth it for the benefit of our clients.

**Skills**: [java](/skill/java/), [aws](/skill/aws/)

## Aerserv/Inmobi Integration

After being acquired by the famous advertising company [InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/), we were tasked with the merging of our two advertising systems. This was grueling, complex work which required many meetings, rollbacks, compromises, and huge amounts of teamwork. In the end, we were late by a few weeks on delivering. But could you blame us?

**Skills**: java, was, git, Jenkins, spring framework, distributed teams, documentation

## Direct Campaigns

In an effort to help our clients run their own advertising campaigns, we set out on a large project called 'Direct Campaigns'. I was in charge of creating the backend API's for every operation a user might want to execute: creating campaigns, deleting campaigns, updating campaigns, etc... It was a large undertaking, especially since I also created all the documentation for it.

**Skills**: [vuejs](/skill/vuejs/), [Ruby Rails](/skill/ruby/), Restful APIs, [HTML](/skill/html/), [CSS](/skill/css/), JQuery, documentation
