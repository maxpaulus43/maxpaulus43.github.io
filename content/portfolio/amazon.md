- **Cross-platform development** across iOS, Android, and backend services

## Role Overview

I started working at Amazon in March of 2019, joining the mobile shopping team in San Francisco. This role provided invaluable experience in large-scale software development, working on applications used by millions of customers worldwide.

At Amazon, I had the opportunity to work on the mobile shopping app for both iPhone and Android. I learned the true meaning of full-stack development - one day writing unit tests for our Android app, the next collaborating on iOS features, then fixing backend service bugs, and sometimes writing incident reports for issues affecting millions of users across the US.

Here are a few project I worked on...

## Location Violation Script

A script that analyzes the entire amazon app and checks for any unauthorized usage of device location. It runs every day, searching for violators. It's weary eyes always scanning the source code. No violations will go unpunished :fist:

**Skills**: [Continuous Integration/Deployment](/skill/ci-cd/), [ruby](/skill/ruby/), [android](/skill/android/), [ios](/skill/ios/)

## Feature Level Location Permissions

A page where users of the amazon app can intricately customize which parts of the app may access location. Written in react native. The amazon app is huge, and it was always a pain to figure out where exactly your location was being used. This page greatly increased transparency to our customers.

**Skills**: [react native](/skill/react-native/), [big data](/skill/big-data/)

## Amazon Multi Factor Auth Notification

In 2019, the EU started enforcing multifactor authentication for all shopping applications. This notification was written in objective C. It displayed at certain times to remind EU customers that they needed to update their payment methods. This project probably gave me the most experience with the whole software development project process.
