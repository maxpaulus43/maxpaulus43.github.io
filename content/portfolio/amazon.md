I started working at Amazon in March of 2019. It's been one of the greatest learning experiences of my life by a large margin. Partially because I moved to the heart of San Francisco in the process. 

At Amazon, I had the opportunity to work on the mobile shopping app for both iphone and android. I learned the true meaning of full-stack while working here. One day, I'm writing unit tests for our android app. The next day, I'm collaborating on a feature for the iOS app. The day after, I'm fixing a bug on one of our backend services. The day after that, I'm helping to write a 3-page document explaining why the app crashed for millions of people in the US (yep, that was me).

Here are a few project I worked on...

## Location Violation Script

A script that analyzes the entire amazon app and checks for any unauthorized usage of device location. It runs every day, searching for violators. It's weary eyes always scanning the source code. No violations will go unpunished :fist:

**Skills**: [Continuous Integration/Deployment](/skill/ci-cd/), [ruby](/skill/ruby/), [android](/skill/android/), [ios](/skill/ios/)

## Feature Level Location Permissions

A page where users of the amazon app can intricately customize which parts of the app may access location. Written in react native. The amazon app is huge, and it was always a pain to figure out where exactly your location was being used. This page greatly increased transparency to our customers.

**Skills**: [react native](/skill/react-native/), [big data](/skill/big-data/)

## Amazon Multi Factor Auth Notification

In 2019, the EU started enforcing multifactor authentication for all shopping applications. This notification was written in objective C. It displayed at certain times to remind EU customers that they needed to update their payment methods. This project probably gave me the most experience with the whole software development project process.
