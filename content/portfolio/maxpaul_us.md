## This Very Website!

This website is a place to discover the most import things about me. I wanted to make something that was better than a [linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-paulus-1b456aa8) or a [resumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/322p5hn4l8co8u5/resume_2019.pdf?dl=0). I wanted a place that anyone could visit to instantly [contact me](/#contact-me) or [see what I was up to](/now/). This was also a great way to hone my [frontend skills](/skill/vuejs/). 

I'm constantly working on this site to keep it up to date for everyone. I know, *everyone* has their own personal websites now. But do their website urls perfectly spell out their name? I think not!

**Skills**: vuejs 

## Technologies Used

### Front end: 

* VueJs: I wanted to use VueJS because I was learning it at the time. I also used it at [aerserv](/portfolio/aerserv/). It's one of the most fun uses of javascript I've ever encountered. Vue CLI helped save a boatload of time in boilerplate setup code.
* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/): Gridsome is a static website generator that creates blazing fast websites. It's comparable to Gatsby or Next or Nuxt. I chose it because it allowed me to use vuejs, which i like.

### Back end: 

* There is no backend! Everything on the site is statically hosted (that's why it's so fast :zap: )

### Infrastructure: 

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): netlify is a way to wire up a git repo to a website domain name. All I have to do is `git push` and my website updates automatically! What a time to be alive.
