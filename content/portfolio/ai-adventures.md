## AI Adventures

A personal exploration into using artificial intelligence as a learning and problem-solving tool for hands-on projects I had never attempted before - gardening and home improvement.

## Impact & Achievements

- **Complete garden setup** from scratch with zero prior experience
- **6+ months** of thriving plants and sustainable growth
- **Hundreds of dollars** in cost savings through data-driven decision making
- **Skills development** in carpentry, gardening, and project management
- **AI methodology** established for learning new practical skills

## Project Overview

Having never gardened or built anything before, I decided to challenge myself by setting up a complete home garden from scratch using AI as my primary learning and decision-making tool. This experiment tested whether AI could effectively guide someone through complex, hands-on projects requiring both theoretical knowledge and practical execution.

## Key Projects & Accomplishments

### Garden Design & Implementation
- **Research & Planning**: Used AI to research optimal plants for my climate, soil conditions, and available space
- **Plant Selection**: AI-guided analysis of what to plant, optimal planting locations, and companion planting strategies  
- **Maintenance Planning**: Developed AI-assisted schedules for watering, fertilizing, and seasonal care
- **Results**: All plants continue thriving after 6 months of growth

### Raised Bed Construction
- **Material Research**: AI-powered analysis of building materials, cost optimization, and durability considerations
- **Design Planning**: Generated construction plans appropriate for my skill level and available tools
- **Carpentry Execution**: Followed AI-guided instructions for basic carpentry techniques and safety practices
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieved significant savings through strategic material selection and DIY approach

## Learning Methodology

This project established a replicable methodology for using AI to learn new practical skills:

1. **Deep Research Phase**: Comprehensive AI-assisted research into fundamentals and best practices
2. **Decision Framework**: AI-guided analysis of options, trade-offs, and optimal choices
3. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Breaking complex projects into manageable, AI-supported steps
4. **Continuous Learning**: Using AI to troubleshoot problems and refine techniques

## Long-term Impact

Beyond the immediate gardening and building success, this project demonstrated the potential for AI to democratize access to practical skills and enable confident tackling of new challenges. The cost savings and sustainable solutions continue to provide ongoing value.
