title: About Me
---

The purpose of this website is to be a storage space for everything
that I want to keep relevant to me. My goals in making this website
are as follows:

1. To learn the following technologies:
     * github pages/jekyll
     * webpack/browserify/other build tools
     * html/css/javascript
     * vue.js (possibly other javascript front-end frameworks like react)
2. To showcase my skills/passions
     * front end skills
     * organizational skills
     * passion for self learning
3. To be a place to easily share my portfolio with other people
