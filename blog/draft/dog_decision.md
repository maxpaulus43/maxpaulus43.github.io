# We Decided to NOT get a Dog. Here's why.

- we thought about getting a dog recently
  - i even bought a book about dogs [here](https://www.amazon.com/Zak-Georges-Dog-Training-Revolution/dp/1607748916/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=zak+dog+book&qid=1565848615&s=gateway&sr=8-1)
  - we went to a dog shelter
  - we met an awesome dog named rocket
  - we also met an awesome dog named blah
  - we didn't get either dog
- 4 main reasons:
  - I wasn't ready for the responsibility
    - I wasn't ready for the risk. I felt scared to let the dog down. 
  - We had different ideas on what a dog means to us
    - i want something that i can control but which also provides some love. My expectations were too tight
    - she wants something that gives life to an otherwise quiet house. sometimes a little bit wild and out of control even.
  - I didn't put enough trust in my girlfriend
    - Lesson: trust is like an act of faith in the other person. being with someone means taking a risk to trust them. I still have to learn that.
  - We knew any decision would have only been a 1 sided choice
    - with a resonsibility like a dog, a mutual decision is REQUIRED
- here's why it was a good choice
  - We still have a lot of other priorities right now
- we're gonna get a dog someday, but not today. And I feel perfectly fine about that.
