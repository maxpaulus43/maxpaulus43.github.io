# Ideas

##### sarcasm

- it's not useful except for the purpose of comedy
- 

##### detective board game

- it puts you in the detective mindset
- it highly encourages greate cooperation
- it's not bogged down in rules
  - that leaves you to focus on the best part of the game: detecting!

##### Decision journal

- I really like the idea of a decision journal
  - It forces you to think about every decision (because ultimately, you're going to writing the decision down to the PUBLIC)
- It's sort of an imprint of your mind a certain point in time.
- It helps others to think about the way they make decisions.
  - It might make a choice abundantly clear for a reader

  - decision to move to San Francisco
  - decision to not get a dog 
  - decision to get a mentor
