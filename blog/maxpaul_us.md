# maxpaul.us Is Born!

This website is long overdue, and should have been live many months ago, but alas, it has been beautifully born! ​I took a weekend and hunkered down on my living room couch to ​bust out the main content of the site. Here are the details:

## Frameworks

**[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)**: I learned Vue at work and It's still incredibly fun to use and work with. Easy choice.

**[Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)**: integrated perfectly with Vue. Plus this gives me an opportunity to work with and learn graphql.

**[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**: at first, I was using Github Pages, but netlify has more features while still being free! Go modern web technologies!

**Markdown**: i've fallen in love with markdown (mostly because of [typora](https://typora.io/)). All my notes on my current laptop are written in it. My now page and all my blogs will be written in markdown. It just looks so good! I'm gonna try to incorporate markdown into more things.
